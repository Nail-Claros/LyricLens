# About LyricLens
Welcome to LyricLens, a project designed to capture your audio recording, recognize the song, fetch the lyrics, and display translations in real-time.

# How it works:
Audio Capture and Song Searching: Record your audio or search for a song. Simply click the large circular button to start recording or enter a song name in the search bar on the home page!

Song Recognition: Our system recognizes the song based on the specific audio data of your recording or the song name you searched for.

Lyric Fetching: We fetch the lyrics for the recognized song from a variety of open source APIs.

Translations: Translations of the lyrics are displayed in your preferred language.

History: See your recent songs in the history page! WARNING: CLOSING THE BROWSER WILL CLEAR YOUR HISOTRY

LyricLens makes it easy to enjoy your favorite music with lyrics in any language!
